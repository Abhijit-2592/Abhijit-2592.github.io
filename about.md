Hi! I am Abhijit Balaji and I am currently a CS Grad student at **The University Of Texas At Dallas**. Prior to this I was a **Data Scientist** at [SPi-Global](https://spi-global.com/) where I was using Artificial Intelligence to solve problems in the e-publishing industry. Recently, I also collaborated with the creators of [SpaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) to integrate [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) with their labeling tool [Prodigy](https://explosion.ai/blog/prodigy-annotation-tool-active-learning) so as to create an **Active Learning** workflow for Object-Detection. More details can be found in my blog post about this. Anything related to AI interests me and I am here to share my adventures with AI.
