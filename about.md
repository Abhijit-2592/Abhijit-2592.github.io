Hello there! I am Abhijit Balaji. I am an Engineer who is passionate about AI and ML. I got exposed to the fascinating world of deep learning when I was looking for alternatives to replace skilled quality inspectors in the manufacturing industries. I successfully built a CNN based vision inspection system using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) which replaced skilled quality inspectors in manufacturing industries. This work of mine has acted as a seed for a startup company based in Chennai, India. Anything related to deep learning and computer vision excites me and I am here to share some of my adventures with AI!
